### Data Overview
The dataset contains various factors that contribute to well-being and quality of life across different countries and years. Key variables include:

- **Country Name:** Identifier for the country.
- **Year:** The year of the data collection.
- **Life Ladder:** A measure of subjective well-being.
- **Log GDP per Capita:** The logarithm of the GDP per capita, indicating economic performance.
- **Social Support:** A measure of perceived support from family and friends.
- **Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth:** Estimated years of healthy life expected at birth.
- **Freedom to Make Life Choices:** A measure of personal agency.
- **Generosity:** A measure of charitable giving.
- **Perceptions of Corruption:** A measure of perceived corruption in government and business.
- **Positive Affect:** A measure of positive feelings experienced.
- **Negative Affect:** A measure of negative feelings experienced.

### Analysis Carried Out
1. **Correlation Heatmaps:** Two correlation heatmaps were created to visualize relationships among the various indicators. The first heatmap focuses on three key variables, while the second includes all indicators.
  
2. **Statistical Relationships:** The heatmaps reveal the strength and direction of correlations (positive or negative) between variables, which helps in identifying patterns of association.

### Insights Discovered
- **Strong Correlations:**
  - There is a high positive correlation between **Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth**, **Social Support**, and **Life Ladder** (0.72 - 0.73), indicating that higher social support and healthy life expectancy are associated with greater well-being.
  - **Log GDP per Capita** shows a strong positive correlation with **Life Ladder** (0.79), suggesting that wealthier countries tend to report higher life satisfaction.

- **Moderate/Slight Correlations:**
  - **Freedom to Make Life Choices** has a modest positive correlation with **Life Ladder** (0.36), indicating that personal freedoms contribute to well-being, albeit to a lesser extent.
  - **Generosity** and **Perceptions of Corruption** exhibit negative correlations with the **Life Ladder** (ranging from -0.25 to -0.46), suggesting that higher perceived corruption and lower generosity could negatively impact well-being.

- **Negative Affect:**
  - **Negative Affect** has a significant negative correlation with multiple indicators of well-being, including **Life Ladder** (-0.58), emphasizing the detrimental impact of negative feelings on overall life satisfaction.

These insights can help policymakers understand the various factors that contribute to well-being and may inform interventions aimed at improving quality of life in different regions.
