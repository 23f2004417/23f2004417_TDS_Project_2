### Overview of `happiness.csv`

The dataset `happiness.csv` includes various indicators of well-being and happiness across different countries and years. The key columns in the dataset are:

- **Country name**: Identifier of the country.
- **Year**: The year the data corresponds to.
- **Life Ladder**: A measure of perceived happiness or life satisfaction.
- **Log GDP per capita**: The logarithm of the Gross Domestic Product per capita, indicating economic status.
- **Social support**: A metric of social relationships and community support.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Expected number of years a person will live in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: The degree of personal freedom individuals feel they have.
- **Generosity**: A measure of charitable behaviors within the population.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Public sentiment on corruption in their society.
- **Positive affect**: Levels of positive feelings experienced.
- **Negative affect**: Levels of negative feelings experienced.

### Analysis Carried Out

1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A heatmap was created to visualize the correlation between the various variables. Notably, Life Ladder shows strong positive correlations with Log GDP per capita (0.79) and Social support (0.73). This suggests that higher GDP and better social support contribute significantly to perceived happiness.

2. **Regression Analysis**:
   - A regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita. The plot illustrates a positive linear relationship, indicating that as Log GDP per capita increases, Life Ladder scores tend to increase as well.

### Insights Discovered

- **Strong Relationships**: The high correlation between Life Ladder and both Log GDP per capita and Social support indicates that economic and social factors are crucial for happiness.
  
- **Regression Findings**: The regression analysis supports the idea that economic prosperity (as indicated by GDP) directly influences life satisfaction, reaffirming the importance of economic health in enhancing quality of life.

- **Multiple Influences**: Other factors like Healthy life expectancy, Freedom, and Perceptions of corruption also play roles, albeit with weaker correlations, suggesting that while economic conditions are important, they are part of a broader spectrum of influences on happiness.

These insights can guide policymakers in focusing on economic and social policies that foster an environment conducive to improving overall happiness.
