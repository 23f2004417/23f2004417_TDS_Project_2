### Overview of `media.csv`

The `media.csv` dataset contains metadata related to various media entries. The columns in the dataset include:

- **Date**: The date when the media was created or published.
- **Language**: The language used in the media.
- **Type**: The type of media (e.g., video, article).
- **Title**: The title of the media.

- **Overall**: A numerical rating representing the overall quality or effectiveness of the media.
- **Quality**: A rating indicating the perceived quality of the media.
- **Repeatability**: A measure of how repeatable or reproducible the media's content is.

### Analysis Conducted

Several analyses were conducted using the dataset, including:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: A heatmap was generated to visualize the correlation between `overall` and `quality` ratings.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Box plots were created for the `overall`, `quality`, and `repeatability` fields to identify and visualize outliers.

### Insights Discovered

1. **Correlation Insights**:
   - The correlation heatmap indicated a high positive correlation (0.83) between `overall` and `quality`, suggesting that higher quality ratings are generally associated with higher overall ratings.

2. **Outlier Insights**:
   - The box plots revealed several outliers in the datasets for `overall` and `quality`. This indicates some media entries deviated significantly from typical ratings, warranting further investigation to understand why these ratings were assigned.

These analyses provide valuable insights into the dataset, highlighting relationships between metrics and identifying areas for deeper analysis regarding outliers.
